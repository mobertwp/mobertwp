- 👋 Hi, I’m @mobertwp. I am a Software Engineering Student in BINUS University. Now I'm in my 5th semester, preparing for the end stage of my university and an internship program on the last year. 
- 👀 I’m interested in Web Development, both front-end and back-end development. I'm also currently interested in learning Mobile Apps Development. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning web development frameworks, such as Laravel, AngularJS, Vue.Js. Although still a beginner, i'll try to keep learning and adapting to do the best for my team. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on web development projects, web development consulting and maybe try in mobile apps development.
